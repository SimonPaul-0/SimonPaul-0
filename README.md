## 🛠️ Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

1. [RPG Game](https://github.com/SimonPaul-0/EpicQuest-Text-Based-RPG-Adventure): This is a text-based RPG in Python. It includes classes for characters, enemies, and a game manager. Players create characters, battle enemies, and can restart after defeat. The game runs in the console, featuring basic progression and randomization.
2. [Password Generator](https://github.com/SimonPaul-0/Password-generator): This is a Python script for generating passwords. Users input desired length and preferences for uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The script creates a password using the specified criteria and displays the result.
3. [Calculator(Simple)](https://github.com/SimonPaul-0/SImple-calculator): This Python script evaluates mathematical expressions with basic operators (+, -, *, %, and /). Users input expressions, and the script calculates and displays the result. It also allows users to see intermediate results during the process. The script validates expressions, resolves parentheses first, and catches errors such as division by zero. The main function runs in a loop, prompting users for input and offering the option to perform additional calculations.
